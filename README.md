# Custom HashMap Implementation

## About

This is a JavaScript project from **personal practice / training** — implementing a fully functional **HashMap** with collision handling using **linked lists**.

Alhamdulillah

## What was needed to complete it:

- Writing a `HashMap` class from scratch
- Implementing collision handling with `LinkedList`
- Supporting dynamic resizing when the load factor is exceeded
- Creating utility methods: `keys()`, `values()`, `entries()`, `length()`
- Handling `clear()` properly and reinitializing the table

## Challenges that I’ve overcome:

- Correctly managing collisions with linked lists
- Updating existing keys without increasing size
- Ensuring `clear()` works and reinitializes the HashMap
- Implementing resizing logic while maintaining existing key-value pairs

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js
